# MAPC 2016 PARAMETERS

Each participating team will play one match consisting of 3 simulations against
each other team. The following numbers of points are awarded after each
simulation:

    Win & money > seed capital: 3 points
    Win & money <= seed capital: 2 points
    Draw: 1 point
    Loss: 0 points

If two ore more teams have the same number of points after all matches have
been played, the summed up scores (money at the end of the simulation)
from each simulation decide and the team with the highest cumulative
score wins.
